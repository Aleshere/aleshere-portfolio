               <p>
                  Search engine optimization, or SEO as commonly known, is the process of implementing changes and strategies in order to stay up at the top of the search engine results, and therefore gain organic traffic. <br>
                  <br>
                  Organic traffic is traffic that comes to you without using advertising or paid tools. It is good healthy traffic. <br>
                  <br>
                  So far so good you will say. But what was a straightforward task a decade ago has now become matter for analysis and long term strategies: Google checks not less than <a href="https://backlinko.com/google-ranking-factors">200 ranking factors</a> for any search query that anyone types in their search bar. In 2012 we had to target keywords, now we need key phrases because the keywords are saturated. And we need a lot more as you can see. We, as SEO specialists, have the important task to take your website, analyze your business needs and keep you up there at the top of the search queries that we understand being the most important to you. <br>
                  That is why SEO is all about you (the business), your tool (the web site), your target (your audience), your challengers (your competition) and your medium (us). <br>
                  <br>
                  How we do that is going to be explained below. <br>
                  <br>
                  As for how important SEO is, let me tell you this: SEO is a long term commitment that builds trust and awareness within your audience, and has the great benefit of being very cost effective. It starts with little things but then once it picks up speed it is going to grow your business exponentially. And lastly, let's not forget that SEO has you work on your competition: it will force you to come into contact with data about your sales and competitors, and in many cases it is an eye opener for businesses. <br>

               <p>
                  You might ask: how are search engine companies deciding how to rank your website? Well they deploy robots that crawl them day and night. Every day. <br> 
                  <br>
                  They are not actual robots of course, but rather kind of fake visitors that scan your content and match it against their matrix. And because they are not human they need all the help you can give to understand what is it that they are looking at. <br>
                  <br>
                  Here comes technical SEO: which is all the things we put in place to make the bot crawling as smooth as possible, so that they can index it properly. <br>
                  <br>
                  Good crawl => good index => good match with search queries. <br>
                  <br> 
                  In practice technical SEO involves all of the following techniques:
                  <ol class="ol">
                     <li>fff</li>
                     <li>fff</li>
                     <li>fff</li>
                     <li>fff</li>
                     <li>fff</li>
                  </ol>

               <p>
                  Our audits always include both technical and on page SEO.
                  Our technical SEO audit will perform checks to assess that the structure on your website is SEO compliant, and has no broken links or problematic redirects.
                  Through our on page SEO audit we will then analyze the keywords or key phrases your are currently ranking for, and scope for potential improvements there.
                  It is here that we also perform checks on your meta tags and media file size. <br>
                  <br>
                  To have a better idea of what both of those audits are examining we recommend you visit our dedicated pages for <a href="/seo/services">technical SEO</a> and <a href="/seo/services">on site SEO</a>.

               <p>
                  Off page SEO includes whatever affects your ranking that is not coming from your own domain.
                  A good strategy is crucial here and be aware that it takes efforts and and a few months to get results. <br>
                  The first thing that we verify during the audit is how many backlinks you have, and above all the quality of those links.
                  Over the years we have seen the rise of companies specialized in selling bulk link traffic pointing to your web site. What these company don't tell is how bad are these no quality links for your SEO. As discussed above, you might also get penalized by Google. <br>
                  <br>
                  Beyond that, we will also run checks on your main competitors to see how they rapport to you.
                  You'll be surprised to know how little business owners seem to know about their direct competitors!

               <p>
                  Social Media is not directly linked to your SEO scores, but it impacts it at a very deep level. Or at least, it can do impact if you know how to use it. <br>
                  <br>
                  We run our social media audits by taking a bird's eye view of the ones you have setup (if any, of course).
                  We ideally recommend having a presence on Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest and Twitter, but every business is different. <br>
                  <br>
                  We run a full analysis and then come up with target audiences for each platform. Nest, we assess if the way you have been interacting with them has been successful so far.
                  If not, we take a note and will tell you why. <br>
                  <br>
                  A little disclaimer here: in order for us to provide a detailed audit, you need to have business accounts setup on social media.
                  If you don't, we can still produce a report, but it won't be as detailed. Alternatively, we can set you up those business accounts (they are free, don't worry) and then wait a few weeks to gain useful data. The process will be a little longer, but you will get more usable data.

                        <p class='accordion'>How much does an seo audit cost?</p>
                        <div class="panel">
                            There are online tools that will analyse basic SEO factors. They are useful as long as you know what to do with those. On the other hand, there are large companies specialized in SEO offering reports from $2000 up to $15000. They offer ongoing reporting for large businesses with seven figures turnovers. If you are a small business looking to improve you SEO with a limited budget and are looking for a customized personal service, you can take advantage of our limited <a class="reddish" href="/#offer">free audit</a>.
                        </div>
                        
                        <p class='accordion'>Ok, but what does seo stand for?</p>
                        <div class="panel">
                           Literally, search engine optimization. In practice: what we can do to have our websites show as high as possible in the search engine page results, for all of the keywords we deem important for our business. And, as a consequence, to attract organic traffic. What is organic traffic? It's the audience we get without having to pay for advertisements or pay per clicks.
                        </div>

                        <p class='accordion'>How many seo keywords should I use?</p>
                        <div class="panel">
                           It is not that simple. The tactic we suggest is to setup a blog: identify 4-5 pillar key phrases, and then another 5-6 cluster key phrases for each pillar. Define sets of LSI words (latent semantic indexing) for each key phrase. Use the pillars as your beacon and write cluster articles around it. After a month, write a cornerstone article encompassing all of the cluster articles you have written. In each article try and use your determined key phrases at the ratio of 1 per 150 words, plus your LSI words. Google will rank your content based on many factors, and this way you can be certain that what you have is always relevant.
                        </div>

                        <p class='accordion'>How many links should I have per page?</p>
                        <div class="panel">
                           Not a magic number, but as a rule of thumb aim for a link for each paragraph. Overall, you can have as many as a couple of hundreds links per page and not suffer any penalties. Above all, the most important thing is to preserve the reading flow and a flawless user experience. Oh, and make sure to alternate external and internal links: yes, incentivize internal traffic is a wonderful SEO booster.

                        <p class='accordion'>Does social media help SEO?</p>
                        <div class="panel">
                            Google has more than once confirmed that <a class="reddish" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udqtSM-6QbQ">social media is not a ranking factor</a> per se. Nevertheless, it certainly has a indirect impact on your website. First of all it'll help build your brand, with the potential to get direct branded searches coming onto you. Secondly, social media shares do have impact on the amount of time people will see your content, and as a consequence, the links you can receive back. Lastly, let's not forget that Bing is going on a different direction and does factor in social media in their rankings.

                        <div class="panel">
                           First of all we need to get ready to start: at times it takes days to get access to the data we need from businesses to begin our audit. Once we are ready, we produce our audit within 7 days for most small businesses, or 14 days for medium sized ones.
