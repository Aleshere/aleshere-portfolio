               <p>
                   A website it very similar to a car: it is perfect the first few months, but then needs regular check ups to stay performing.
                   Technology changes on a daily basis, code that was top notch 3 years ago is outdated by now, and that is bad for speed, security and SEO, just to name a few.
                   Updates are necessary to fight malware attacks and heck, keep that website performant. <br>
                   <br>
                   At the same time, we realize that businesses want to focus on their day to day sales rather than on that notification requesting to update the website.
                   The Coding Lab provides ongoing web maintenance for websites based on most CMS such as WordPress, Wix, Squarespace, Drupal and Hubspot. <br>
                   <br>
                   We will make sure that your web site is up to date at all times: we will report back anytime we perform updating tasks of course, and make sure to avoid downtime whenever possible. We always check that the latest security upgrades are in place. We look out for algorithm updates so that your SEO is always optimal. And let's not forget to renew that copyright or those T&Cs. <br>
                   <br> Whether you are a blogger, a small ecommerce business or a larger sized company we are here ready to sort you out.

               <p>
                   Believe me I have seen way too many websites with clutter and unnecessary code. Some of them were so slow to load that were losing most of their first time visitors within seconds. It is easy to add plugins and new features, but give it a few months and you will begin deal with conflicts and unpredictable behavior from your webpage. <br>
                   <br>
                   The secret to success here is to have regular clean ups, ideally from someone who has a good understanding of the tech used and is going to spend time to analyse your website and remove the clutter. And someone who will fix your dead links and broken image paths. There is nothing worst for a business: it is like being on a High Street and have a cracked window. <br>
                   <br>
                   And why not talk about SEO? The more you post the higher the likelihood to make mistakes or forget SEO practices. I know it should not happen, and most of this can be automated nowadays, but the issue is real. That is why The Coding Lab recommends monthly SEO clean ups - meta tags, content updates, alt captions etc - both as standalone maintenance services or as part of our <a class="reddish" href="/seo/">SEO plans</a>.

                    <p>In 2020 US unemployment payoffs were suddenly set aback. <br>
                        They were issued via Cobol, a language created in 1959. <br> 
                        Simply put, not enough people knew how to use it anymore.

               <p>
                  
                  Most of the times everything goes as hoped and you don't even notice. Then something unexpected happens - human error, server crash, an hacking attempt - and you are left disheartened wondering why you did not back up your files earlier on. But by that time it's already too late. <br>
                  <br>
                  We are here to be vigilant and avoid your data losses. The Coding Lab will schedule regular backups of your database making sure you are always covered.
                  We recommend cloud storage for your backups and guess what? Most web hosting platforms offer that, but we can also help finding you the right provider if not. <br>

                    Email hosting is a general term that denotes a service that hosts your email. Gmail is an email hosting service for example.
                    More specifically, it can also mean a service that allows you to host your own email account: an example is The Coding Lab and the email address info@thecodinglab.it.
                    The possibility to have your own email often comes bundled with the web hosting service your purchase, but that is not guaranteed.

                    <br>
                    Some cheap hosting plans do not include that.
                    Regardless, it is pretty much always possible to have your own email address when you also own a domain. We at The Coding Lab would be happy to assist with the setup.

                        <p class='accordion'>Why some websites do not have a www?</p>
                        <div class="panel">
                            Fun fact: a domain does not include www. The www we are accustomed to is actually a subdomain, for example: google.com is the domain, whereas www.google.com is the subdomain. The trick is that we can decide what's redirecting to what, so typing either one works just fine, at the speed of light. At least in most cases. It is important to know that SEO can be impacted by the way domains and subdomains work, so it is always recommended to seek expert advise when setting them up.

                        <p class='accordion'>How much should I spend on a domain name?</p>
                        <div class="panel">
                            This is totally dependant on your budget and priorities: there are domains for sale for thousands of dollars, as there are domains for as little as 0.99 cents. The difference is about the complexity of the word, the history of the domain (if any), the type of TLD - which is the part after the last dot (like .com) - and many more. The Coding Lab can help taking down the cost through appraising your needs and identifying opportunities for best value domains out there. If you go your own way watch out for bundling options: do you really need a .xyz domain?

                        <p class='accordion'>How many domains are there?</p>
                        <div class="panel">
                            According to the <a href="https://www.verisign.com/en_US/domain-names/dnib/index.xhtml?section=executive-summary">latest data</a> there are about 370M domains registered worldwide as per Q3 of 2020. Domains .com are by far the most popular, followed by .tk and .de which respectively stand for Tokelau (and small archipelago in the Pacific) and Deutschland (that is Germany). If you are wondering, .tk domains are so high because they are mostly used by companies with phishing purposes.

                        <p class='accordion'>Are domain names case sensitive?</p>
                        <div class="panel">
                            Domain names are 99% of the times case insensitive. Whether you type amazon.com or AmaZOn.com it won't matter. Different story for whatever comes after .com and the slash: that is part of the URL and it is case sensitive, because it has to match precise locations in the website folder structure. so amazon.com/product is different than amazon.com/PRODUCT. Watch out: I mentioned 99% of the times because over the last decade it has been introduced an international standard to help non English speaking countries eliminate the language barrier while accessing the net, and some of those domains are case sensitive. Most likely it won't affect English speaking clients, but it is good to know.

                        <p class='accordion'>Are email addresses case sensitive?</p>
                        <div class="panel">
                            the part before the @ is theoretically case sensitive, although all major providers treat it as case insensitive to avoid confusion. The part after the @ is 100% case insensitive. Bottom line: always try to use lowercase letters and you'll be fine. If you use one of the major providers, typing uppercase letters most likely won't affect your delivery.

                        <p class='accordion'>What does DNS mean?</p>
                        <div class="panel">
                            Literally, Domain Name System. Computers do not understand words, so DNS is the way to translate the common words we type (such as google.com) into IP addresses (such as 23.253.163.53) which is the way website are indexed on servers. It gets more complicated than this, but for simplicity let's say that DNS make sure you receive the website you type in your search bar.

                        <div class="panel">
                            ICANN - International Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers - established Whois in 1982 and as per their <a class="reddish" href="https://whois.icann.org/en/history-whois">description</a>, it is a “free, publicly available directory containing the contact and technical information of registered domain name registrants.” In practice it is a database where anyone can see (look up) information about ownership of a domain and DNS settings. Owners might be private citizens or, most often, organizations acting as intermediaries between the citizen and the provider.
